# ESP32 House Current Monitoring

# Use Case
IÂ´ve first tried to develop this code when i wanted to monitor my house consumption and to be on top of my solar production.
Side note my house has a 3 phase connection so i have a 3 phase inverter installed.
Displaying the information in real time can give me an edge on when or what phase of the house can i use some electronic device
to better manage my electric bill.
I choose MQTT as the protocol used on this project, using Node-Red and MOSQUITTO as a broker on my Raspberry Pi.

# Features
It has 3 phases being processed by the ESP32 and sent to 3 different topics.
There are 3 relays that control 3 sockets off a room, having control over them also.

#Too develop
Adding a 4 phase to have complete 3 phase of the house plus the solar current input.
But for now it will do

This is the board made by me with all the other components(relays,power relays and switches for added security)
